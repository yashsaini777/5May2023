            <p>The tickets were sponsored by U.P. BJP secretary Abhijat Mishra, who also watched the movie along with the female
                students.</p>
            <img src="./img/4.avif" />
            <p>LUCKNOW To save them from ‘love jihad’, 100 Hindu female students of Navyug Kanya Post Graduate College were
                shown ‘The Kerala Story’ -- the recently-released movie loosely based on the lives of alleged ISIS women
                recruits -- at a cinema hall in Lucknow on Saturday.</p>
            <p>The tickets were sponsored by U.P. BJP secretary Abhijat Mishra, who also watched the movie along with the female
                students. Following the show, Mishra put out a tweet (in Hindi) saying, “Show #KeralaStory to save girls from
                Love Jihad (sic)... Be alert, be safe.”</p>
            <p>Used frequently in political discourses, “Love jihad” refers to the concept of a Muslim man luring a Hindu woman
                into accepting Islam. “It is very important to protect them (young women) from falling into the trap of Muslim
                boys,” added Mishra.</p>
            <p>When asked about his move to show the movie to female students, Mishra said, “Firstly, love jihad is an insult to
                love. Secondly, they are making our children anti-national. Everyone is free to practice their religion but it
                is unacceptable to subject others to physical exploitation and push them onto the wrong path.” He also claimed
                that during his three-month stint in Kerala, he witnessed how Hindu women were being lured by Muslim men.</p>

            <h1 class="a7">Watch: How MS Dhoni masterminded Rohit Sharma's second consecutive duck in IPL 2023 during CSK-MI tie
            </h1>
            <p>The stand out wicket was the dismissal of MI skipper Rohit Sharma, who incurred his second consecutive in IPL
                2023, given how Dhoni masterminded the wicket.</p>
            <img src="./img/7.avif" />
            <p>At one point in the ongoing IPL 2023, Chennai Super Kings had launched themselves to the top of the points table.
                But back-to-back defeats - against Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings - followed by rain abandoning the Lucknow
                Super Giants and Chennai's campaign suddenly had a few questions to be answered. On Saturday, Chennai hosted
                their arch rivals Mumbai Indians at home with the aim to end their winless run and reclaim their supremacy at
                the top of the table. (CSK vs MI Live Score, IPL 2023)</p>
            <p>At home, and against familiar opponents, Chennai had to trust their strengths, and combine that with a bit of MS
                Dhoni magic and the home team made a staggering start to the match after winning the toss and opting to bowl
                first. Inside three overs, Mumbai were three down with all their top order back in the hut. And the stand out
                wicket was the dismissal of Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma, who incurred his second consecutive in IPL
                2023, given how Dhoni masterminded the wicket.</p>
            <p>It happened in the third over of the match when Dhoni decided to play some mind games with Rohit. There was a
                backward point, there was short third and a slip stationed while Dhoni stepped up to the stump with Deepak
                Chahar in the attack. It was slower delivery from the pacer and Rohit went down on one knee to play the lap shot
                over short fine leg, but he played the shot a tad too early as the ball took the outside edge, clipped his thumb
                and then lobbed towards gully region. Ravindra Jadeja, who was at backward point, ran in comfortably and
                completed the catch.</p>
            <p>Chahar was elated as he pointed towards Dhoni, appreciating him for his plan in the dismissal while commentators
                on air were left flabbergasted at how Rohit fell into the trap.</p>

            <p>LUCKNOW To save them from ‘love jihad’, 100 Hindu female students of Navyug Kanya Post Graduate College were
                shown ‘The Kerala Story’ -- the recently-released movie loosely based on the lives of alleged ISIS women
                recruits -- at a cinema hall in Lucknow on Saturday.</p>
            <p>The tickets were sponsored by U.P. BJP secretary Abhijat Mishra, who also watched the movie along with the female
                students. Following the show, Mishra put out a tweet (in Hindi) saying, “Show #KeralaStory to save girls from
                Love Jihad (sic)... Be alert, be safe.”</p>
            <p>Used frequently in political discourses, “Love jihad” refers to the concept of a Muslim man luring a Hindu woman
                into accepting Islam. “It is very important to protect them (young women) from falling into the trap of Muslim
                boys,” added Mishra.</p>
            <p>When asked about his move to show the movie to female students, Mishra said, “Firstly, love jihad is an insult to
                love. Secondly, they are making our children anti-national. Everyone is free to practice their religion but it
                is unacceptable to subject others to physical exploitation and push them onto the wrong path.” He also claimed
                that during his three-month stint in Kerala, he witnessed how Hindu women were being lured by Muslim men.</p>

            <h1 class="a7">Watch: How MS Dhoni masterminded Rohit Sharma's second consecutive duck in IPL 2023 during CSK-MI tie
            </h1>
            <p>The stand out wicket was the dismissal of MI skipper Rohit Sharma, who incurred his second consecutive in IPL
                2023, given how Dhoni masterminded the wicket.</p>
            <img src="./img/7.avif" />
            <p>At one point in the ongoing IPL 2023, Chennai Super Kings had launched themselves to the top of the points table.
                But back-to-back defeats - against Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings - followed by rain abandoning the Lucknow
                Super Giants and Chennai's campaign suddenly had a few questions to be answered. On Saturday, Chennai hosted
                their arch rivals Mumbai Indians at home with the aim to end their winless run and reclaim their supremacy at
                the top of the table. (CSK vs MI Live Score, IPL 2023)</p>
            <p>At home, and against familiar opponents, Chennai had to trust their strengths, and combine that with a bit of MS
                Dhoni magic and the home team made a staggering start to the match after winning the toss and opting to bowl
                first. Inside three overs, Mumbai were three down with all their top order back in the hut. And the stand out
                wicket was the dismissal of Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma, who incurred his second consecutive in IPL
                2023, given how Dhoni masterminded the wicket.</p>
            <p>It happened in the third over of the match when Dhoni decided to play some mind games with Rohit. There was a
                backward point, there was short third and a slip stationed while Dhoni stepped up to the stump with Deepak
                Chahar in the attack. It was slower delivery from the pacer and Rohit went down on one knee to play the lap shot
                over short fine leg, but he played the shot a tad too early as the ball took the outside edge, clipped his thumb
                and then lobbed towards gully region. Ravindra Jadeja, who was at backward point, ran in comfortably and
                completed the catch.</p>
            <p>Chahar was elated as he pointed towards Dhoni, appreciating him for his plan in the dismissal while commentators
                on air were left flabbergasted at how Rohit fell into the trap.</p>
